# Lab 4 - Licensing

## 2. Add a License

Note the license at the bottom of the document

## 3. Why add a license

Licenses make it abundantly clear of how others can use your work. This is good for both you since it protects your work from being used in a way that you don't intend. It also gives people using your work peace of mind since they know you won't pull the rug out from under them and pursue legal action for using the work you've given them.

## 4. Importance of only using licensed works

As mentioned before, the default assumption is that all rights are reserved. This means you cannot be certain if the work is in public domain without a license. One possible outcome of using a work without an explicit license is that you build something with it but then get a takedown notice from the owner of the unlicensed work

## 5. Why the Web beat Gopher

Overall, I agree with this analysis of why the web attracted a much larger audience than gopher. The "Failure to follow the open systems model" mainly addresses the fact that while the community creating the web was committed to open development, the team developing Gopher believed they were best positioned to make design decisions. Since magnitudes more people can be involved with the web, it is easy to see why the web was able to obtain a critical mass of early adopters faster than Gopher. In addition, since the Web's RFC system allowed users to propose new standards and improve existing ones, the Web was very fluid in adapting to needs of a univeral community and user pool. In contrast, the Gopher's approach of making decisions internally led to fewer active participants and a product that may not have fit the needs of the people using it.

## 6. Justification for .NET Core's MIT License

I think the MIT License is perfect for .NET Core's intended purpose. After all, .NET Core was created so that developers can easily create their own, potentially commercial, applications. It would be extremely detrimental to the project's adoption if there were any claims preventing the monetization of projects made with .NET Core, so a key requirement for the project's license is that it fully support's end users' ability to commercialize their products. That is on regard in which the MIT License excels, since it essentially says "do with this as you want, however you want." I strongly believe Microsoft's choice of MIT License is a key reason people choose to use .NET in their projects.
